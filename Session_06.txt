Public vs Private IP
How Internet works
Monolithic vs Microservices
Security Groups --> Firewalls


Manual configuration
--------------------

3 tier architecture

Private IP: 192.168.1.2
Modem IP: 192.168.1.1
Public IP: 59.182.2.116

1995 we had only public IP. NAT

Private IP will be allocated by Modem


Why Private IP?
-----------------
IpV4 is going to be exhausted?
before 1995 ISP were giving ipv4 address directly to laptop.
NAT --> Network Address Translation
laptop1: 192.168.1.2
laptop2: 192.168.1.3

latency
security

DNS(Domain Name System) --> IP dictionary
--------------------------------------
Humans can remember names not numbers, computers cant understand names they can only understand numbers

ISP is responsible to provide IP address of domain

facebook.com --> 157.240.228.35

facebook server is not in our home network,

AirTel --> some network --> you can start your own ISP --> ACT
BSNL
JIO
VI

US exchane point --> which ISP is providing internet to facebook datacenter --> fb data center --> it will reach fb server

Wireless

Monolithic vs Microservices
--------------------------
application is very big
	it has frontend
	it has backend
1. A simple change also need to be deployed again.
2. Maintainance is a big headache
3. HTML/JS developers, you will JAVA/.NET developers
	1000 -- JAVA developers
	500 -- Fronend developers
4. amazon-v0.0.1.ear --> enterprise archive
5. amazon-v0.0.2.ear --> 1 day downtime, your business will go down.

API based application
------------------------
HTML/JS team is different
Backend team is different

API -->

Fronend always calls backend through API calls, Backend will send data in JSON format and images

roboshop
-------------------
It is ecommerce

User
Products
Cart
Order management
Payment
Shipping
ratings

amazon-v0.0.1.war --> web archive
if one error in one component can make entire website go down

1000 Java developers

1. You have to completely develop in JAVA
2. Migration is very difficult in monolithic, entire application is on single programming language
3. Maintaince and monitoring is very difficult
4. Scaling is very difficult at the time of more traffic


cart and product catalogue will get more traffic on big billion day.

Microservices
-----------------------
User --> user-0.0.1 --> Java
Products --> catalogue-0.0.2 --> NodeJS
Cart --> .NET 
Order management
Payment
Shipping

API 
All microservices communicate with each through Private IP and API calls..

entire application is developed by developers, 
they will give us documentation about dependencies,
we start configuring the projects

Manual
Shell Script
GitHub 
Ansible
Jenkins - CICD
Terraform

deploy as a monolithic
deploy as a microservices


Kubernetes

	
Firewall
---------------
Inbound --> traffic coming to your server
	source: internet i.e any server outside
	destination: your Ec2 instance
Outbound --> traffic going out from your server
	source: your EC2 server
	destination: whatever you want to send
	
only port no 80 and 22 are allowed, 
0.0.0.0/0 --> everybody on the internet

Public IP vs Private IP
Microservices advantages
Monolithic vs Microservices
how Firewall works
How internet works -> just understand how the request flow
